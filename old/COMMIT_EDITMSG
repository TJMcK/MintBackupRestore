This is the first version of the script files >>Backup_Linux_Settings<< and >>Restore_Linux_Settings<<.  I hope that these two bash scripts will facilitate the migration to newer Linux versions
without loosing the settings of the former version. I hope they will be continuously improved by the community over time. Note that both files have been tested on my system and worked flawlessly,
the >>Restore_Linux_Settings<< script is still in beta stage. 

Have fun,
Mint_BackupRestore
